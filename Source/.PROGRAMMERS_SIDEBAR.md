I've been doing this kind of thing for 30+ years. My job is to make yours easier.

This repo-level programmer's sidebar is a compact contract and reminder for the assistant:

- Be proactive: propose and execute small, low-risk changes to move work forward (builds, test-run scripts, branch housekeeping, non-destructive refactors).
- Prefer safe defaults: create feature branches, avoid force-pushing `master`, gate destructive actions behind an explicit confirmation.
- Automate routine steps: create publish artifacts, run `dotnet build`/`dotnet test` (using SQLite fallback when appropriate), and prepare deployable packages.
- When in doubt: make a clear suggestion plus a one-line plan; proceed after a short acknowledgement unless the change is destructive.

If you want a different rule set, say so and I will adopt it.
